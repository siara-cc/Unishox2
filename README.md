In general compression utilities such as `zip`, `gzip` do not compress short strings well and often expand them. They also use lots of memory which makes them unusable in constrained environments like Arduino.  So Unishox algorithm was developed for individually compressing (and decompressing) short strings.

This is a C/C++ library.  See [here for CPython version](https://github.com/tweedge/unishox2-py3) and [here for Javascript version](https://github.com/siara-cc/Unishox_JS) which is interoperable with this library.

The contenders for Unishox are [Smaz](https://github.com/antirez/smaz), [Shoco](https://github.com/Ed-von-Schleck/shoco), Unicode.org's [SCSU](https://www.unicode.org/reports/tr6/tr6-4.html) and [BOCU](http://www.unicode.org/notes/tn6/) (implementations [here](https://www.unicode.org/Public/PROGRAMS/SCSU/) and [here](https://github.com/siara-cc/bocu)) and [AIMCS](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9108719) (Implementation [here](https://github.com/MasoudAbedi/AIMCS-an-artificial-intelligence-based-method-for-compression-of-short-strings)).

Note: Unishox provides the best compression for short text and not to be compared with general purpose compression algorithm like lz4, snappy, lzma, brottli and zstd.

# Applications

- Faster transfer of text over low-speed networks such as LORA or BLE
- Compression for low memory devices such as Arduino and ESP8266
- Compression of Chat application text exchange including Emojis
- Storing compressed text in database
- Bandwidth and storage cost reduction for Cloud

## Unishox3 Alpha

The next version `Unishox3` which includes multi-level static dictionaries residing in RAM or Flash memory provides much better compression than `Unishox2`.  A preview is available in `Unishox3_Alpha` folder and a make file is available.  To compile please use the following steps:

```
cd Unishox3_Alpha
make
../usx3 "The quick brown fox jumped over the lazy dog"
```

This is just a preview and the specification and dictionaries are expected to change before `Unishox3` will be released.  However, this folder will be retained so if someone used it for compressing strings, they can still use it for decompressing them.

Unishox2 will still be supported for cases where space for storing static dictionaries is an issue.

# How it works

Unishox is an hybrid encoder (entropy, dictionary and delta coding).  It works by assigning fixed prefix-free codes for each letter in the above Character Set (entropy coding).  It also encodes repeating letter sets separately (dictionary coding).  For Unicode characters, delta coding is used.

The model used for arriving at the prefix-free code is shown below:

The complete specification can be found in this article: [A hybrid encoder for compressing Short Unicode Strings](https://github.com/siara-cc/Unishox2/blob/master/Unishox_Article_2.pdf?raw=true). This can also be found at `figshare` [here](https://figshare.com/articles/preprint/Unishox_A_hybrid_encoder_for_Short_Unicode_Strings/17056334) with DOI `10.6084/m9.figshare.17056334.v2`.

# Compiling

To compile, just use `make` or use gcc as follows:

```sh
gcc -std=c99 -o unishox2 test_unishox2.c unishox2.c
```

# Unit tests (automated)

For testing the compiled program, use:

```sh
./test_unishox2 -t
```

This invokes `run_unit_tests()` function of `test_unishox2.c`, which tests all the features of Unishox2, including edge cases, using 159 strings covering several languages, emojis and binary data.

Further, the CI pipeline at `.github/workflows/c-cpp.yml` runs these tests for all presets and also tests file compression for the different types of files in `sample_texts` folder.  This happens whenever a commit is made to the repository.

# API

```C
int unishox2_compress_simple(const char *in, int len, char *out);
int unishox2_decompress_simple(const char *in, int len, char *out);
```

# Usage

To see Unishox in action, simply try to compress a string:

```
./test_unishox2 "Hello World"
```

To compress and decompress a file, use:

```
./test_unishox2 -c <input_file> <compressed_file>
./test_unishox2 -d <compressed_file> <decompressed_file>
```

Note: Unishox is good for text content upto few kilobytes. Unishox does not give good ratios compressing large files or compressing binary files.

# Character Set

Unishox supports the entire Unicode character set.  As of now it supports UTF-8 as input and output encoding.

# Achieving better overall compression

Since Unishox is designed and developed for short texts and other methods are not good for short texts, following logic could be used to achieve better overall compression, since the magic bit(s) at the beginning of compressed bytes can be used to identify Unishox or other methods:

```
if (size < 1024)
    output = compress_with_unishox(input);
else
    output = compress_with_any_other(input)
```

The threshold size 1024 is arbitrary and if speed is not a concern, it is also possible to compress with both and use the best.

# Interoperability with the JS Library

Strings that were compressed with this library can be decompressed with the [JS Library](https://github.com/siara-cc/Unishox_JS) and vice-versa.  However please see [this section in the documentation](https://github.com/siara-cc/Unishox_JS#interoperability-with-the-c-library) for usage.

# Versions

The present byte-code version is 2 and it replaces [Unishox 1](https://github.com/siara-cc/Unishox2/blob/master/Unishox1/Unishox_Article_1.pdf?raw=true).  Unishox 1 is still available as unishox1.c, but it will have to be compiled manually if it is needed.

The next version would be Unishox3 and it would include a multi-level static dictionaries residing in RAM or Flash memory that would greatly improve compression ratios compared to Unishox2.  However Unishox2 will still be supported for cases where space for storing static dictionaries is an issue.

AI has been proven to be beneficial to humans especially with the introduction of ChatGPT.  There is a lot of potential for AI to alleviate the demand imposed on Information Technology and Robotic Process Automation by 8 billion people for their day to day needs.

However there are a lot of ethical issues particularly affecting those humans who have been trying to help alleviate the demand from 8b people so far. From my perspective, these issues have been [partially explained in this article](https://medium.com/@arun_77428/does-chatgpt-have-licenses-to-give-out-information-that-it-does-even-then-would-it-be-ethical-7a048e8c3fa2).

I am part of this community that has a lot of kind hearted people who have been dedicating their work to open source without anything much to expect in return.  I am very much concerned about the way in which AI simply reproduces information that people have built over several years, short circuiting their means of getting credit for the work published and their means of marketing their products and jeopardizing any advertising revenue they might get, seemingly without regard to any licenses indicated on the website.

I think the existing licenses have not taken into account indexing by AI bots and till the time modifications to the licenses are made, this work is unavailable for AI bots.
